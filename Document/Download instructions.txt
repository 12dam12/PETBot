Guide to Download and Run Source Code from GitHub
When downloading source code from GitHub and setting up the development environment, please follow these steps:

1. Download Source Code from GitHub:
First, access the project's repository on GitHub at [link_repository].
Click on the "Code" button and choose the download method, for example "Download ZIP," or copy the URL of the repository to use with Git.
2. Unzip (If Using Download ZIP):
After downloading, unzip the ZIP file into the desired directory on your computer.
3. Install Node Modules (If Needed):
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code.
Run the following command to install necessary dependencies:
bash

npm install react-scripts


4. Run the Application:
Once the necessary node modules are successfully installed, you can run the application using the command:
bash


npm start



This command will start a local development server and open the application in your default browser.
Notes:
In case the repository does not include the "node_modules" directory, make sure you have installed the necessary packages using the npm install command or use a platform like Vercel to manage dependencies.

If you encounter any issues during the installation or running of the application, refer to the [link_documentation] section for more detailed information or contact the development team.

Best of luck!
